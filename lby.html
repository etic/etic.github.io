            <h1>Life by You</h1>
            <h2>Paradox Tectonic</h2>
            <p>Life by You is a life sim game by Paradox Tectonic. I helped as a technical artist on lighting, modder
                tools, shaders, vfx, and animations.</p>

            <h3>Lighting</h3>
            <p>I added ambient interior lighting that scales with time of day and culled lights + shadows so they fade
                in and out based on distance to the camera. I also added support for allowing players to turn on and off
                lights and made lights automatically turn on/off when humans enter and exit a building.</p>
            <img src="img/IMG_1201.PNG" alt="">
            <h3>Time of Day</h3>
            <p>I tuned the time of day lighting and postprocessing system and added support for blending between
                postprocessing volumes and other lighting data based on the current time. In the final screenshot,
                I simulated and baked a fire simulation in Blender to make the campfire effect.</p>

            <h3>Modder Tools</h3>
            <p>To fully test clothing assets, artists needed to view the clothing layered on top of other clothing and
                on characters with different body proportions. I created a clothing test tool to quickly build outfits
                and adjust character sliders.</p>
            <img src="img/IMG_1194.PNG" alt="">
            <p>To create interactions and behaviors in the game we developed a visual scripting system that runs
                in-game. I skinned the editor and added a number of scripting nodes to the system.</p>
            <img src="img/IMG_1195.PNG" alt="">
            <p>Characters are created with the UMA unity asset which has a complex setup. I created a wizard to generate
                the UMA-specific assets for every type of clothing asset in the game. The wizard itself is a
                ScriptableObject so that the UMA assets can be quickly re-generated if the base models or textures
                change.</p>

            <h3>Face Texture Baking System</h3>
            <p>One request from the artists was to be able to have a variable number of textures on the face, for
                tattoos and details like moles and wrinkles. Initially the face was a single shader but we broke it into
                a multi-step baking process where an albedo, normal, and mask texture are all composited separately and
                put together in a final shader. The final shader only needs four textures but supports a wide amount of
                customization.</p>

            <h3>Bed Sheet Effect</h3>
            <p>To have characters under bed sheets, I created a vertex shader that offsets the bed sheets based on
                colliders attached to the human. This allows the humans to move under the covers and still show motion
                on the bed sheets.</p>
