            <p>Wobbleton is a stylized building toy inspired by Townscaper and Dr. Seuss. <a
                    href="https://etic.itch.io/wobbleton">Play here.</a></p>
            <p>The toy lets users fill and clear cells in a 3D grid which results in a building. When the grid is
                updated, meshes are generated to fit the 3D grid. The positions and normals of the meshes are distorted
                by a perlin noise field to achieve a dr seuss-like effect. Because the meshes are distorted directly
                instead of through a shader, we can use them as mesh colliders to handle player interaction. This perlin
                noise field is used to transform the positions of smaller objects and particle effects as well.</p>
            <p>The meshes used to fill the 3D grid are chosen through wave function collapse (WFC). One at a time,
                pieces are randomly chosen that can fit in the gaps of the parts of the 3D grid that were modified.
                Then, any old pieces that were in the way are removed and any remaining gaps from that are filled in. To
                determine if a piece can fit in a particular location, each piece has a list of cells relative to its
                origin that must be filled or empty. Pieces can be rotated 90 degrees on the Y axis, so each piece has
                four possible configurations for its filled and empty cells.</p>
            <p>Two grids are used to represent the building, an occupancy grid and an asset grid. The occupancy grid
                stores bool values for whether a cell is filled or not. The asset grid holds references to the meshes
                spawned in the world. The structure of the grid went through two iterations. First, a grid the same size
                as the occupancy grid was used which had references to all 6 faces of each cell. However this
                complicated the WFC code because faces needed to be explicitly specified, so the asset grid was updated
                to be twice as large as the occupancy grid and pointed to the meshes directly. An individual cell in
                this grid could refer to the center of a cell, a face, an edge, or a corner of a mesh depending on its
                location. This let the WFC code iterate over the assets uniformly.</p>
            <p>A rippling effect happens through the structure when you add or remove a block. This was accomplished
                with a vertex shader, which uses a position at the center of the target block and distorts the mesh at a
                given radius away from the center, which increases over time. The animation of the particles when you
                remove a block are also driven by a shader, which simulates a light moving over a sphere. A third party
                shader was used for the outline effect.</p>
